RateMeMaybe
===========
- Asks the user if (s)he wants to open the Play Store to rate your application when certain requirements are met (see below). This can and should be configured to be very cautious. **Don't annoy your users!**
- Dialog icon, title, message and so on can be **easily customized**
- Code is heavily based on [AppRate] by Timothee Jeannin
- Supports rating in AndroidPit App Center (```setStore("androidpit")```), Google Play (```setStore("play")```) and Amazon App-Shop (```setStore("amazon")```)
- License: MIT

To use it, you can simply copy [RateMeMaybe.java] and [RateMeMaybeFragment.java] into your project.
[RateMeMaybe.java]: https://github.com/yanniks/RateMeMaybe/blob/master/code/src/com/kopfgeldjaeger/ratememaybe/RateMeMaybe.java
[RateMeMaybeFragment.java]: https://github.com/yanniks/RateMeMaybe/blob/master/code/src/com/kopfgeldjaeger/ratememaybe/RateMeMaybeFragment.java

Example usage in your FragmentActivity:
```java
RateMeMaybe rmm = new RateMeMaybe(this);
rmm.setPromptMinimums(10, 14, 10, 30);
rmm.run();

// More customized example
RateMeMaybe rmm = new RateMeMaybe(this);
rmm.setPromptMinimums(10, 14, 10, 30);
rmm.setStore("play");
rmm.setDialogMessage("You really seem to like this app, "
				+"since you have already used it %totalLaunchCount% times! "
				+"It would be great if you took a moment to rate it.");
rmm.setDialogTitle("Rate this app");
rmm.setPositiveBtn("Yeeha!");
rmm.run();
```
